AudioWerkzeugeBibliothek - ChangeLog

New in Version 2.1 (07/2024)
- Support for *.opus-Files
- Support for CoverArt in VorbisComments (*.ogg and *.opus)
  Support only for the "official" version, using METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE as Key. The
  unofficial, deprecated variant "COVERART" is NOT directly supported. However, you 
  can check for this Key, and try to get the picture data from it.
  
Changes in version 2.1 (07/2024)
- New enumeration type TPictureType (Unit `AudioFiles.Declarations`).
  This type replaces the Byte or Cardinal parameter "PicType" (or similar) for 
  picture-related methods in Flac and ID3v2.
  Both metadata constructs use a fixed set of 21 different picture types (like "other", "icon", "front cover", "back cover", "artist", ...) for additional
  information about this picture. Instead of a simple Integer value, AWB now uses
  a more "readable" enumeration type.
  For interaction with e.g. ComboBox.ItemIndex a simple typecast should work.
- Array Picture_Types with names for the defined picture types changed to
  cPictureTypes: Array[TPictureType] of string = (...). 
  Loops using the old Picture_Types-array should be changed to use index tpye TPictureType instead of Integer.
- Cleanup in type TAudioError. Renamed/removed/added some error types.
- Classes TFlacFile, TOggVorbisFile and (new) TOpusFile are derived from a common
  ancestor TBaseVorbisFile that provides access to the VorbisComments.
  Note that CoverArt in Flac files is NOT stored within the VorbisComments.
